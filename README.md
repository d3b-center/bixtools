# D3B Docker Image Build Instruction Hub

This repo contains build instructions that we use at the Center for Data-Driven Discovery in Biomedicine (D3B) and in the Kids First Data Resource Center (KFDRC). The most updated production images are stored in the [SBG docker registry](https://cavatica.sbgenomics.com/developer/docker). This requires a Cavatica login and individual images may require separate permission to access.

Legacy versions of some images are stored in the [KFDRC Dockerhub](https://hub.docker.com/u/kfdrc/). The images on Dockerhub are deprecated and will not be updated.
